# Burger Logger

## Description
Utilizing the fundamentals of MySQL and ORMs, I constructed a web page that
allows users to order burgers from arguably one of the worlds' favorite fry 
cooks that lives in a pineapple under the sea. The application tracks new 
orders that are placed along with storing a history of burgers that have
already been eaten.
